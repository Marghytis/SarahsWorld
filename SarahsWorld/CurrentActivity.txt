Sarah now crashes into the ground at the beginning using a script
To do (crater):
_ Water maybe should flow into the resulting hole.
_ Creatures and other objects should react
	-> need physics for objects like trees?? That's a huge task..
	-> maybe just delete everything in the crater area
_ make the crater a bit more rough
To do (meteor impact -> explosion) 
_ make pieces of the terrain fly around?
_ camera shaking
