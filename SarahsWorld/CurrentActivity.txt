Just created a function that enables deformation (shifting of columns) after the landscape has been generated.
This will be used for the meteor impact. For now a crater is created around the mouse position when pressing middle mouse button while holding B.
To do (crater):
_ Water maybe should flow into the resulting hole.
_ Creatures and other objects should react
	-> need physics for objects like trees?? That's a huge task..
	-> maybe just delete everything in the crater area
_ make the crater a bit more rough
To do (meteor impact -> explosion) 
_ make pieces of the terrain fly around?
_ dust
_ fire blast
_ camera shaking

Bugs:
_ If a walking thing is standing still, Physics doesn't check whether there is still ground below it, so it hovers when making a crater.
	-> might not be relevant when adding acceleration due to the impact blast
	-> should still be fixed for the sake of correctness of the underlying engine
